          A troll is a being in Nordic folklore, including Norse mythology. In
          Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated areas
          of rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units,
          and are rarely helpful to human beings. In later Scandinavian
          folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far
          from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered
          dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance
          varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave
          exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque
          characteristic about them. Trolls are sometimes associated with
          particular landmarks in Scandinavian folklore, which at times may be
          explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight.
